    // By checking the output, we see that the thread "run" is actually named "main". This means that it's not actually creating a new thread if we use the run() method. How interesting!

    // Even though the "start" thread does print something in the middle of the second loops output, it's clear to see that there's a big difference in timing between the two loops.


    // Finally, what's probably the most important part. The Daemon thread! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

    // Daemon threads are low priority threads that don't actually restrict the JVM. Usually the JVM will terminate when all the threads have finished execution. However, Daemon threads don't restrict the JVM from terminating.
    // This means that once all NON Daemon threads finished execution, any remaining Daemon threads will be terminated instantly.
    // You set a Daemon thread with .setDaemon(), but can't setDaemon() after the thread has already started.
